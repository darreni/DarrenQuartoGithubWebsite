Quarto can be used to write formatted text along with snippets of runnable code from Julia (or Python, R, etc.). 

#### Some Julia code:

```{julia}
using Plots
f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 35
plot(f)
```

#### You can even run R from Julia:

```{julia}
using RCall
R"""
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9)
y <- x + rnorm(length(x))
plot(x, y, type = "b", col = "blue")
y
"""
```
